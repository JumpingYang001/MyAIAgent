# AI Agent Interface Guide

## Overview
Unlike a traditional chat interface that only responds to queries, an AI Agent is an autonomous system that can:
1. Plan and execute tasks proactively
2. Use tools independently
3. Make decisions based on context
4. Handle complex workflows
5. Maintain its own state and goals

Implemented the agent-based interface:

1. `agent_guide.md` - A comprehensive guide explaining:
   - How an autonomous agent differs from a simple chat interface
   - Core components (Planning, Tool Management, Memory, Decision Making)
   - Usage patterns and example workflows
   - Best practices and security considerations
   - Future improvements

2. `agentchat_interface.py` - An implementation of a proactive agent that can:
   - Autonomously plan and execute tasks
   - Manage its own state and memory
   - Monitor the environment for issues
   - Use tools proactively
   - Handle complex multi-step workflows

The key differences between this agent implementation and the previous chat interface are:

1. **Autonomy**: The agent can initiate actions on its own, like monitoring for code errors and fixing them automatically.

2. **Planning System**: Instead of just responding to queries, it breaks down goals into concrete steps and creates execution plans.

3. **Memory Management**: It maintains working memory, long-term storage, and a context window to make informed decisions.

4. **State Management**: The agent has distinct states (IDLE, PLANNING, EXECUTING, EVALUATING) and can handle complex workflows.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress of task execution with visual indicators.

To use this new agent interface, you would:

1. Run it like a normal Python script:
```bash
python agentchat_interface.py
```

2. Then you can give it high-level goals instead of specific commands:
```
> Optimize the performance of this codebase
> Set up a new TypeScript project
> Find and fix security vulnerabilities
```

The agent will automatically:
- Break down the task into steps
- Choose and execute appropriate tools
- Monitor the results
- Adjust its approach if needed
- Provide progress updates
